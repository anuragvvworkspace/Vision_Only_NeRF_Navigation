# Vision-Only Robot Navigation in a Neural Radiance World

### Abstract Highlights
trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is emenable to constraining the robot's full pose and control inputs.
