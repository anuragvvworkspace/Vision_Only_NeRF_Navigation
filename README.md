# Vision-Only Robot Navigation in a Neural Radiance World

### Abstract Highlights
trajectory optimization algorithm that avoids collisions with high-density regions in the NeRF based on a discrete time version of differential flatness that is amenable to constraining the robot's full pose and control inputs.


### Introduction

- ${\color{#717d7e}Deep\ learning\ geometric\ representation\ called\ NeRFs}$
- Optimal control remains a fundamental tool in robotic motion
planning

Combines trajectory planner and the filter in a receding horizon loop to provide a full navigation pipeline for a robot to dynamically maneuver through an environment using only an RGB camera for feedback.
